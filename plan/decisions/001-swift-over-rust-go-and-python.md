# 001. Swift over Rust, Go and Python

Decided: 2026-10-14    Status: current

Swift wins because the tool runs only on macOS, and on macOS every engine the project needs is first-class in Swift. The M0 spike confirmed the choice: PDFKit, Core Graphics, Vision and Core ML all ran from Swift with the Command Line Tools alone, without Xcode.

| Option | For | Against |
|---|---|---|
| **Swift** | PDFKit, Core Graphics, Vision (including the macOS 26 document recognizer), Core ML and MLX Swift are all direct calls. It ships as one binary with fast startup. | Few reference implementations to port from. A smaller pool of contributors. |
| Rust | Memory safety for parsing untrusted files. One core can serve many languages. | Apple frameworks come through the `objc2` bindings, and MLX is second-class. A Swift layer is still needed for the newest Apple APIs. |
| Go | A simple CLI and a single binary. | Weak PDF and machine-learning libraries. Apple frameworks need cgo. |
| Python | Every leading parser (Docling, MinerU) and model is written in it. | A PyTorch install weighs gigabytes, and models take seconds to load. |

The M0 spike tested the three riskiest bets, and the decisions below record its answers:

- The text quality of PDFKit against PDFium on real PDFs.
- The speed and quality of a layout model converted to Core ML.
- The reading order that Apple's document recognizer gives on born-digital pages.

Existing Swift projects show the pieces work: mac-ocr and vision-book-digitizer call Apple's document recognizer, and `mlx-swift-lm` already runs GLM-OCR.
